                <p>        This is my first real website! I made a another <a href ='Htmlcode.html'>website</a>, before, but this one is much better! I started coding consistently about a week ago and now look where i am! I learned how to code from Codecadamy, Pluralsight<sup>1</sup> and a <u>lot</u> of help from my dad. I created this on and through Github/Working Copy.</p>
